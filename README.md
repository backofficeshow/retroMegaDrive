# retroMegaDrive

My conversion of electro retro model's (https://retroelectromodels.com) "Official SEGA Mega Drive 1:2.3 scale model" to a working mini.

Features include via GPIO:

RFID Reader
Power on-off switch
Power LED

I am using a more recent Raspberry Pi because it will need bluetooth to the ourside world. The RFID Keys will be inserted into the mini cartridges and the software will look for the rom title stored in the key itself.
